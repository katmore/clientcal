Scheduling, job, crew, and customer management web application for construction companies.

[ClientCal Project](https://github.com/katmore/clientcal)

## Description
ClientCal is a PHP/MySQL based project initially released in 2006 to facilitate small the management of customer info, job scheduling, job site info, and work crew scheduling for small to medium sized construction operations (SMBs). As a traditional HTML form based application ut has proved to be very stable over the years. I have released this project in preparation for improvements to the UI (to make it mobile friendly) and implementing a RESTful API backend.
